# PCB breadboard for Solder Sidekick – Based on Soldered Electronics Design

![PCB breadboard/protoboard](./OUTPUTS/V1.1.1-Locking/screenshot.png)

This repository contains a modified version of the **PCB breadboard/protoboard** by [Soldered Electronics](https://www.soldered.com), reused with permission under the **TAPR Open Hardware License (OHL v1.0)**.

We’re using this board design as a **demonstration platform** for the [Solder Sidekick](https://soldersidekick.com) — an open hardware kit that converts an Ender 3 3D printer into a hands-free through-hole soldering robot.
